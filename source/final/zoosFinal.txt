It's seriously a perfect value for a day out with the family. We went the week before Christmas, and there were very few people there, which made it perfect. Our kids had a blast and got to spend as much time as they wanted at each attraction. The whole place was surprisingly big. I come from San Diego, where the San Diego Zoo can take a couple days to really take in, so I didn't have great expectations for Woodland Park. However, it was pretty big! We spent a good... 6 hours there.\\n\\nAdmission pricing was great - we'll probably get a yearly pass since you only have to go a couple times to make it worth it. \\n\\nMy only minor complaint was the food. We got lunch - some fried chicken sandwiches, mac and cheese, and a cheeseburger. It was pretty expensive, and it was just okay. What can you do, though?\\n\\nOverall, great experience. Highly recommended.

Some exhibit renovations inhibited our experience and the food staff workers at food stands were less than pleasant, but we had an excellent time.  Get there EARLY for parking.  When we arrived at opening there were a ton of spaces but when we were leaving during mid afternoon people had been circling the lots trying to find something.  One of our favorite things was seeing the up close giraffe encounter.  You have to be there early in the AM to see it.  They walk the giraffes from their pens to the wildlife enclosure and we were within feet of them.  A truly great experience.
