I was rapidly becoming \"that guy\" who can play sloppy intros to 300 songs, but nothing else.\\n\\nI looked around the web, and settled on Pascal because of his credentials and reviews, and I could not be happier with my choice.  \\n\\nThe thing that makes Pascal special is that he put as much effort into becoming a great guitar teacher as he did in becoming a great guitar player.  There are a lot of musicians out there who think of teaching guitar as a way to supplement their music career, Pascal has made teaching the guitar his music career and it really shows.  Every lesson is tailored exactly to my ability at that time.  If ever I have had particular trouble with something Pascal is ready with additional material, alternate ways to learn it, different ways to explain it.  No matter what the technique or concept, Pascal has seen this mistake before and knows just what to do.  Some days I leave with many pages of material to master, and some days just one or two.  It is all about how slowly or quickly I am picking up the new thing, and all about learning things the right way so that the foundation is solid when I am ready to advance to the next level.  There is no schedule or competition (except with myself) and the only objective is to learn more and get better.\\n\\nTo show examples in action Pascal routinely finds 70s and 80s hard rock for me (not every single note is from Guns-n-Roses of course, but if a particular concept relates to something in a familiar song from the genre, that\\'s the one Pascal will pick for me to master).  You do not have to learn jazz!  (I mean if jazz is your thing I am certain that Pascal can teach you that.)  \\n\\nI really doubt that there is a player at any level (or in any style) who would not learn a lot from Pascal (that is if you are prepared to be humble and possibly review some foundational material you think you know already... if you knew it, Pascal would not be teaching it to you... he can hear that your timing is off, or if you didn\\'t hit all of the strings in that chord, and so can your audience).  (Once, while I was performing an exercise from the previous lesson, Pascal had his back to me digging in his filing cabinet for my next materials and said \"Did you play the fifth note with an upstroke?\"... He heard that, it was supposed to be a down stroke and he heard a difference so slight I didn\\'t even know I was doing it.)\\n\\nIf you are a beginner as I was, my advice is to commit to four lessons with Pascal.  By the end of that time you will hear that you are advancing, and more importantly you will understand where you were and where you are going.  It might seem kind of basic at first (which is why I say to go with at least four) but it does not take very long to understand how much better you will be with strong fundamentals.  If, instead, you learn to play badly, and you practice regularly, eventually your speed will improve... and then you will play badly fast which actually sounds worse than playing badly slow... all that work for less than nothing.\\n\\nI have been taking lessons for about a year and half.  I can play some Lead Guitar now.  And I can play some real songs now.  Even those 300 intros are getting tight, that is to say I now play them with the right timing, technique, phrasing and feel!  \\n\\nPS - If Pascal says \"it\\'s time for the Harmony Classes\", do it!  Though I resisted at first (as with everything else Pascal has taught me) the harmony classes have immediately made me better at playing guitar, and have provided a foundation that makes the next thing and the next thing and the next thing easier, faster, and better!', u'relative_time_description': u'2 months ago', u'author_url': u'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110251713809031765693/reviews', u'time': 1511915067, u'profile_photo_url': u'https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-SxXxNLIvFMs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACSILjWQ1twDdZEmx5ePeaPnTyZ3DSJf2g/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg'}, {u'rating': 5, u'author_name': u'John Rhyder', u'language': u'en', u'text': u\"After a Hiatus of playing, I started to take lessons again with Pascal.

So, I decided to look into private lessons, even though I was nervous about the one-on-one dynamic.

I discussed this with Pascal before and at my first lesson. I can\\u2019t tell you how amazing it felt a few months later when we played a song together and I had no fear or anxiety. \\n\\nI credit this to the fun and relaxing atmosphere Pascal has created in his studio space which makes it easy to learn, ask questions and enjoy my lessons.  He has a deep passion for music which is infectious.

I've taken lessons from two other teachers before and one thing that really stands out about him is that he puts a lot of thought into designing each student's curriculum to best help achieve that student's unique goals. He puts a lot of emphasis on learning the fundamental skills that will help a student be able to express himself musically (skills such as gaining familiarity with the fretboard, being able to play the scales at any point on the fretboard, etc.) rather than just teaching a bunch of random songs and chords to memorize.\\n\\nHe is great at explaining things and is very patient when teaching new theories/skills. He also listens very closely to what the student says and adjusts his teaching plan accordingly - for example, I mentioned in an offhand comment once that I wanted to eventually do some ear training. The very next lesson, he had used this knowledge and planned certain exercises related to familiarizing myself with the major scales and printed out the accompanying hand outs that would get me closer to that goal. I was pretty impressed by this.\\n\\nIn addition to all of this, he's a very positive guy and is just a joy to work with.

When I decided to work in Seattle this past summer, I realized I was going to be unable to take my main instrument, the drum set, with me. Because of this, I decided to learn guitar. While I had always dabbled with guitar, I was hesitant to take private lessons for only 3 months.  After my first lesson though, all that hesitation melted away. Pascal has a palpable love for music that is present in everything he teaches. He was able to take strengths garnered from my prior musical experience and tailor lessons in such a way that I would not be relearning concepts that transferred from the drum set, but rather focused on the areas that would most effectively help me grow as a guitarist in the short time that I had. \\n\\nWhile he has an organized guitar lesson method that can easily keep people of any skill level busy for years, he also listens when you say that there is a particular thing that you want to learn. To the same end, one skill that Pascal has that I\\u2019ve come to admire in music teachers is willingness to tell you when something you want to learn may not be the best use of your time. Often, teachers will spend multiple lessons (and, as a result, hundreds of dollars of your money) teaching you a concept that you ask to learn that may be too advanced for you at that stage in your musicianship. Pascal avoids this pitfall by instead teaching you concepts that are at your level, that will challenge you, yet eventually allow you to progress to those more advanced concepts and learn them in a much more successful manner.  \\n\\nFinally, he has fantastic taste in music, so if you ever want to be exposed to some of the best music of the past century, Pascal is the guy to talk to. His lessons not only teach you an instrument, but also shares with you a love of music that is wonderful and infectious. I highly recommend him for all ages and experience levels!\\n\\nThank you for a fantastic summer!\\n-Brandon', u'relative_time_description': u'3 years ago', u'author_url': u'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115553978053253122636/reviews', u'time': 1409166505, u'profile_photo_url': u'https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-vyhAadNG86Q/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/dv8PaRqkEgA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg'}]", "priceLevels": "N/A", "name": "Seattle Guitar Teacher", "phone": "+1-206-282-5990", "country": "US", "yelpURL": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/seattle-guitar-teacher-seattle-2?adjust_creative=ehFLGk-NHTxL6kq5roKvnA&utm_campaign=yelp_api&utm_medium=api_v2_search&utm_source=ehFLGk-NHTxL6kq5roKvnA", "placeId": "ChIJua29nQIUkFQRFC8CuObdjkw", "yelpId": "seattle-guitar-teacher-seattle-2", "openingHours": "{u'weekday_text': [u'Monday: 12:00 \\u2013 9:00 PM', u'Tuesday: 12:00 \\u2013 9:00 PM', u'Wednesday: 12:00 \\u2013 9:00 PM', u'Thursday: 12:00 \\u2013 9:00 PM', u'Friday: 12:00 \\u2013 9:00 PM', u'Saturday: 12:00 \\u2013 5:00 PM', u'Sunday: Closed'], u'open_now': False, u'periods': [{u'close': {u'day': 1, u'time': u'2100'}, u'open': {u'day': 1, u'time': u'1200'}}, {u'close': {u'day': 2, u'time': u'2100'}, u'open': {u'day': 2, u'time': u'1200'}}, {u'close': {u'day': 3, u'time': u'2100'}, u'open': {u'day': 3, u'time': u'1200'}}, {u'close': {u'day': 4, u'time': u'2100'}, u'open': {u'day': 4, u'time': u'1200'}}, {u'close': {u'day': 5, u'time': u'2100'}, u'open': {u'day': 5, u'time': u'1200'}}, {u'close': {u'day': 6, u'time': u'1700'}, u'open': {u'day': 6, u'time': u'1200'}}]}"}
